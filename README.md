# hconf
hconf is a little module to manage simple configurations I made for myself. Maybe you need this...

# How to use
## Classes
    Hconf
        + __init__(fieldDefinition, path, serialer=Serialer)
        + existPath()                                                     return True if the path exists
        + load()                                                          Loads the hconf
        + save()                                                          Saves the hconf
        + SET(key, value)                                                 Sets the field -key- to the value -value-
        + GET(key)                                                        Returns the value of the field -key-
        + GET_ALL()                                                       Returns a dict with all fields {key:value}
        (+ invalidVersionFound(myVersion, foundVersion, foundValues)      This function is called if while loading the Hconf a version found with an other version-code (normaly this func. im empty. You have to override in an own class)
                                                                              -myVersion- is the excepted version -foundVersion- is the in the Hconf found version -foundValues- are the vaues found in the Hconf
                                                                              if this function returns True the p√∂d hconf is converted successfull. You have to save the hconf if you change sth. with self.SET()
    FieldDefinition
        + __init__(version=1)
        + addField(field)                                                 adds a field to the Hconf-FileDefinition
    
    Field
        + __init__(key, default=None, types=[])                           the types-list contains all datatypes this field can have. If there's no entry all types are excepted.
    
    Serial
        + _serial(o)                                                      this function has to be overridden. -o- contains a dict which hs to be 'converted' to a string which has to be returned
        + _unserial(o)                                                    this function has to be overridden. -o- contains a 'converted' string which has to be 'unconverted' to a dict which has to be returned
    
    cPickleSerial  <- Serial                                              this class is a serialer which uses cPickle and not pickle. This is much faster if you want to convert big or many data


## Exceptions
    _base_                                                                all exceptions contains the functions of this class
        + getTraceback()
        + getMsg()

    CannotSaveHconf  <- _base_                                            this exception is raised if there was an error while saveing Hconf
    CannotLoadHconf  <- _base_                                            this exception is raised if there was an error while loading Hconf
    InvalidKey       <- _base_, __builtin__.KeyError                      this exception is raised if an invalid key was tried to set or get
                                                                              you can catch this with the built-in KeyError
    InvalidFieldType <- _base_, __builtin__.TypeError                     this exception is raised if you tried to give an field an invalid value
                                                                              you can catch this exception with the built-in TypeError

## Example

            self.addField( Field("password", "", [str]) )
            self.addField( Field("number", 0, [int, float]) ) # the field 'number' can contains the types 'int' or 'float'
            self.addField( Field("alwaysStart", True, [bool, int]) )
            self.addField( Field("dummy") ) # the field 'dummy' has no default-value (=None) and can contains all types

                    return True #return True means that the convertig was successfull. You have to save the Hconf if you made changes!
                except:
